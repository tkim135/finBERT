Some weights of the model checkpoint at None were not used when initializing GPT2ForSequenceClassification: ['lm_head.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing GPT2ForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing GPT2ForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of GPT2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at None and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
